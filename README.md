# Spotify-Recommended-Playlist
Generates a playlist on Spotify according to a vibe/description and a seed song. Recommendations are based on community generated LastFM user behavior.

## Challenges
As of November 27 2024, Spotify Web API cut developer access to recommendation features, which led to the inclusion of LastFM recommendation data in my project. The result is a more varied series of recommendations as it is based on community generated play behavior and a description. The result is less tied to specific genre than traditional recommendation services.
